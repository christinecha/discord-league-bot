### Development

1. Open up `example.env`. You need to fill in these secret values for this repo to run.
2. Create a Firebase project that uses Firestore. Then, follow [this link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk) for instructions on generating a **private key file** for your service account. This will contain all the Firebase values you need.
3. [Create a Discord bot.](https://discord.com/developers/applications) This link will require you to log in. Then you can create a new application and create a Bot for it. The `BOT_ID` is the application's client id (under General Information) and the `BOT_TOKEN` is just called Token (on the Bot page).
4. Follow the instructions in the `example.env` file to update & rename it to `.env`.
5. Finally for the fun stuff! Let's run the server locally:

```
yarn install

# DEV MODE
yarn run dev
open http://localhost:4242 (client app)

# PRODUCTION MODE
yarn run build && yarn start

```

6. To run tests locally, you'll need to [install Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/emulator-setup). Then:

```
# In one window
firebase emulators:start

# In another window
yarn run test
```
